== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I see the warning "Noproxy requires Prospress plugin be active." on Admin screens =

Noproxy requires the plugin "Prospress" to be installed and active.
If Prospress is installed & active but noproxy displays error message "Noproxy requires Prospress plugin be active." check that Prospress plugin directory is either `/wp-content/plugins/prospress` or `/wp-content/plugins/Prosress`.
If Prospress has been installed in a directory other than the default (`/prospress/` or `/Prospress/`) you may specify your Prospress directory on line 20 of noproxy.php.
Uncomment Line 20 and replace the text `custom_prospress_directory` with the precise directory name of your Prospress plugin.
